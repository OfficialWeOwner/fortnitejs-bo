# fortnite-lobby-bot

## How to get started:

You will need:
* node.js
* spare epic games account

First you will need to clone the repository, then use ``npm install`` to install the required packages for the bot run. After that, create a file named config.json. Feel free to copy the config I made below:

```{
      "email"  : "email@gmail.com",
      "password" : "password123",
      "netcl" : "UPDATE",
      "cid" : "CID_029_Athena_Commando_F_Halloween",
      "bid" : "BID_105_GhostPortal",
      "eid" : "EID_Glitter",
      "pickaxe_id" : "Pickaxe_ID_116_Celestial",
      "banner" : "InfluencerBanner57",
      "banned_color" : "defaultcolor",
      "banned_level" : "100",
      "friendaccept" : "false"
}
```

After you've done that and filled out all of the fields, just run the bot by typing ``node index.js``.

If you have any issues be sure to let me know in the issues section and I'll try my best to help.
